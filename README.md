# harbour-audiocut
Experimental audio manipulation app for Sailfish. Cut audio files or recordings and apply effects like fade-in, emphasize or denoiser. This app will install python3-pydub automatically from here. If not, this has to be done manually.

As of SF 3.3 there is no mp3-encoder included in the OS yet. If you need to save as mp3, you have to install LAME encoder as well, e.g. from here: https:/openrepos.net/content/lpr/lame.
